# Basic-Php-PDO-CRUD
This is a very simple php CRUD code written using PDO. Users can register, login, update account and delete account. It checks for users with the same username and avoid duplication of username. Very simple code and easy for new php developers.
# Note: This code does not provide any level of protection (except MD5() encryption of the password) and cannot be used for a full software development.
